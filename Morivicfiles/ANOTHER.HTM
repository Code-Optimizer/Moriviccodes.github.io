<p> Becoming a code pro is the dream of many, but<del> only</del> few take the pain and stress of practicing to become one. <br/> My journey into coding has been a very innovative and fun filled one. i have made a lot mistakes and encountered a lot of challenges but this has helped to make me improve on my coding skills. <br/> Below is a picture of me when i started versus me now. <br/>

Magnetic Inversion (MI) and Analytic Signal techniques were applied to map geological structures controlling mineralisation in Enyigba area of Ebonyi State. Forward modelling technique was employed in the quantitative interpretations to determine magnetic susceptibilities and type of mineralisation prevalent in the study region. High resolution aeromagnetic data acquired from Nigerian Geological Survey Agency was used in this study.

Enyigba is located within Ikwo and Abakaliki Local Government Areas of Ebonyi State on latitudes         and         and longitude         and         (Figure 1) and falls within the lower Benue sedimentary formation of southeastern Nigeria. The region is noted for Lead-Zinc mineral (Pb/Zn) mining activities by the locals. Pb/Zn deposits have been found in the lower Abakaliki Basin where metallic ores occur as epigenetic fracture controlled vein deposits, and are restricted to gently dipping carbonaceous black shale spatially distributed (Fatoye et al., 2014). Cratheley and Jones (1965) had earlier attempted to map possible trends of these deposits within the entire Benue Trough (Figure 2). They noted that the outcrops are exposed by road cuts, some agricultural activities, mine sites, and streams/River channels and covered about 54.56 km2.
